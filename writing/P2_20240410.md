### Familes who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay texes that support the stae education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally, I completely disagree with this view.

For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to reduce taxes for families who pay for private education. Firstly, it would be difficult to calculcate the correct amount of tax reduction for  these familes, and staff would be required to manage this complex process. Secondly, we all pay a certain amount of tax for public service that we may not use. For example, most people are fortunate enough not to have to call the police or fire brigade at any time in their lives, but they would not expect a tax reduction for this. Finally, if wealthy familes were given a tax discount for sending their children to private schools, we might have a situation where poorer people pay higher taxes than the rich.

In my opinion, we should all be happy to pay our share of the money that supports public schools. It is benefiical for all members of society to have a high quality education system with equal opportunities for all young people. This will result in a well-educated workforce, and in turn a more productive and prosperous nation. Parents of children in private schools may also see the advantages of this in their own lives. For example, a company owener will need well qualified and competent staff, and a well-founded education system can provide such employees.

In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should be made for people who choose private education.
