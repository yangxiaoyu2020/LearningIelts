### There are many different types of music on the world today. Why do we need music? Is there traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?

It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.

Music is something that accompanies all of us throughtout our lives. As children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as form of enjoyment. Children delight in singing with other, and it would appear that act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. Later in life, people's musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.

In my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. Internatioal pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold  by business people. Traditonal musci, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as national song, connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.

In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international musci.
